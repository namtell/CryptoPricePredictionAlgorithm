# CryptoPricePredictionAlgorithm

This ML model uses market cap data, real-time cryptocurrency data, and the Pytrends and Google APIs to predict future crypto prices. I followed the guide created by Chalita Lertlumprasert (litalert on GitHub). I also used her Towards Data Science guide found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-cryptocurrency-price-prediction-5fb2b504a110. I used this model as a reference to predict other cryptocurrency prices and use updated data since her guide was created in 2017/2018. To run this code, first install the necessary packages that are imported at the start of the code. Run the code from top down with each cell using Jupyter Notebook. I developed this model under my mentor, Professor WenZhan Song, at the University of Georgia as well as with support from my high school, the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology.

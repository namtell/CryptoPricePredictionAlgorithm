# CryptoPricePredictionAlgorithm

This ML model uses market cap data, real-time cryptocurrency data, and the Pytrends and Google APIs to predict future crypto prices. I followed the guide created by Chalita Lertlumprasert (litalert on GitHub). I also used her Towards Data Science guide found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-cryptocurrency-price-prediction-5fb2b504a110. I used this model as a reference to predict other cryptocurrency prices and use updated data since her guide was created in 2017/2018.
